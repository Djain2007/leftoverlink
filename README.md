Hackathon Submission: This project was built for the 2025 Unity Hacks Hackathon.

üéØ Our Mission: Addressing SDG 2 - Zero Hunger
In a world where tons of edible food are wasted daily, many still go to bed hungry. LeftOverLink directly addresses the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger by creating an efficient, technology-driven bridge between food surplus and food scarcity. Our platform provides a simple, localized solution to a global problem, ensuring that good food nourishes people, not landfills.

‚ú® How It Works
Our platform is built around a seamless, three-step process designed for speed and impact, connecting three key user groups:

1. Donors (Restaurants, Bakeries, Individuals)

2. NGOs / Receivers (Shelters, Food Banks)

3. Volunteers (Community Heroes)

Donors quickly post details about their surplus food, including type, quantity, and an optional photo. The process is designed to take less than 60 seconds.

NGOs in the same city receive instant notifications about new donations. They can view details and claim the food with a single click.

If an NGO needs help with transport, a delivery request is created. Local volunteers can see these requests and accept the ones that fit their schedule.

This creates a complete ecosystem where food is rescued and delivered to those who need it most, with minimal friction.
